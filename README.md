# Load and Validate JSON Files


See the TypeScript declaration file: [typings/json-file/json-file.d.ts](typings/json-file/json-file.d.ts)

See the tests for how to use this module: [src/ts/test-json-file.ts](src/ts/test-json-file.ts)

This is built with TypeScript and uses gulp for builds and task management.

**Problems**

This should support JSON directly without loading from a file.


## Setup for Build
```
npm install
```

You should install these globally:
- typescript
- tsd
- gulp
- mocha

## Build and Test
```
gulp
```
